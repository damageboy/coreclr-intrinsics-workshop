# Exercise 1

This exercise is relatively easy to get right, but can pose a challenge if your aim is not
merely to vectorize, but to be the fastest!

We'll taking an array of integers, and returning the number of negative elements in it.

The provided function `CountNegativeScalar` achieves this.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write the vectorized counterpart for that function.

You'll need to use:

- AVX2 Loading / Storing
- Comparison
- ???

You should probably do some RTFMing and plan how you want to tackle the counting.
There are many ways to get this right. And they all make use of slightly different intrinsics!
Which ones will you be using?

Have fun!
